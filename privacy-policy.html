            deliveries in some situations, for instance, if you are located in
            a large area, such as a park.

          <p>
            We recognize that information related to your orders could contain
            private information. However, we may be required to disclose your
            information to third parties including law enforcement agencies
            when required to protect and defend our legal rights, protect the
            safety and security of users of our Services, prevent fraud,
            comply with the law, respond to legal process, or a request for
            cooperation by a government entity. We have developed a process
            that strikes a balance between protecting customer privacy and
            responding to valid law enforcement requests. In the event of
            sale, transfer, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar
            event we may transfer your information to one or more third
            parties as part of that transaction.

            Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information
          </h2>
          <p>
            Keeping your personal information current helps ensure that we
            provide you with the most relevant offers. You can access and
            update your personal information via your Account profile. While
            we are ready to assist you in managing your subscriptions,
            deactivating your account, and removing your active profile and
            data, we cannot always delete records of past interactions and
            transactions. For example, we are required to retain records
            relating to previous purchases through our Services for financial
            reporting and compliance reasons. In addition, because of the way
            we maintain certain services, after you delete certain
            information, we may temporarily retain backup copies of such
            information before it is permanently deleted.

            account is active or as needed to provide you services and to
            maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting
            purposes. We will also retain and use your personal information as
            necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes,
            and enforce our agreements. OJA may retain aggregate or anonymized

            addition, our Services may contain links to other websites not

            You may choose to enable or log in to our Services via various
            online services, including social networking services like
            Facebook. Our Services also may enable you to access social
            networking services such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram
            (collectively, “Social Network”) directly or indirectly through
            our Services. When you link a Social Network account to OJA or log

            collect relevant information necessary to enable our Services to
            access that Social Network and your data contained within that
            Social Network. We also may share your information with the
            operator of that Social Network to facilitate or enhance delivery
            of that Social Network or other services to you. A Social Network
            may provide us with access to certain information that you have
            provided to them, and we will use, store, and disclose such
            information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
            Additionally, a Social Network may collect personal information
            and information about your use of our Site or Services
            automatically. The manner in which a Social Network collects,
            uses, stores, and discloses your information is governed by the
            policies of such third parties and OJA shall have no liability or
            responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any
            Social Network that may be enabled within our Services. You may
            also have the option of posting your activities on our Services
            and other content to a Social Network when you access content
            through our Services. For example, you may post to Facebook that
            you placed an order with OJA. Keep in mind that your activity on a
            Social Network is governed by that Social Network and not by OJA,
            and may be visible or accessible to the public.
