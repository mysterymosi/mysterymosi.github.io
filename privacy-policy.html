              use your location information to provide more accurate deliveries
              of your orders. You can choose whether to enable the location
              tracking feature through the settings on your device or Platform
              or when prompted by the OJA mobile app. If you choose to disable
              the location feature, the Dasher will not receive precise location
              information from your device, which may compromise the accuracy of
              deliveries in some situations, for instance, if you are located in
              a large area, such as a park.

              responding to valid law enforcement requests. In the event of
              sale, transfer, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar
